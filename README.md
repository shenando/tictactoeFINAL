## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I really wanted to push myself to improve with OOP best practices, so that was the main focus of this project. I did this by having two main classes, a board class (where all the physical things the user interacts with is held) and a game class (where all the behind the scenes game operations take place). 

## Optimizations

I want to add the ability for users to pick what symbol they are. I also want to give the option for players to play against another human or a computer. I'm hoping to add this functionality soon.

## Lessons Learned:

The beauty (and pain) of OOP was highlighted for me in this project. Being able to see the benefits of encapsulation first hand has been so important. Figuring out how to organize my classes/objects was a challenge but I'm glad I pushed through!
